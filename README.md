# Welcome to Python Bootcamp Data Analysis for Beginners
 
## Bootcamp description
In this bootcamp we get you started with Python programming. The first two lessons will cover Python basics, starting from the 3rd lesson we will be moving towards pandas for data analysis. 

After finishing this bootcamp you will:
* understand high-level code in general
* know a bit how your computer and its file system works
* feel familiar with the Python language
* know what git and github is
* play with pandas and perform basic data analysis with it

Do not worry if you have zero programming knowledge and do not know how to install Python packages or how to navigate the file system of your computer with a terminal. We will cover this as well.

In this repository you will find: 
* Instructions how to install Python and Jupyter notebooks with miniconda on your computer
* The content to follow our live lessons with exercises, home assignments and solutions.
